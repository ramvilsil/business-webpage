# Small Business Web Page

Simple small business web page with React, styled with custom CSS.

## Purpose
The web page was developed primarily to practice CSS positioning and to gain familiarity with JavaScript React. The most difficult aspect of this project was implementing the hamburger navbar for mobile devices. This project ultimately helped enhance front-end abilities.
